# Documentation

## üìÑ Overview
This application is inspired by the game **DOTA** and provides a list of all available **heroes**.  
Users can tap on a hero to view **detailed information** about their abilities and attributes.

The project is built with a **multi-module architecture** to enforce clear separation of concerns and improve scalability and maintainability.

All data is fetched from an **open API** using the **Ktor** HTTP client.

The app is developed using the **Model-View-Intent (MVI)** architecture and follows **SOLID principles** and **Clean Code** practices.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Ktor**  
  Used to perform HTTP requests and consume the open API.

- **Hilt**  
  Used for dependency injection to promote modular, testable code.

- **Jetpack Compose**  
  Used to build the declarative and responsive UI.

- **Kotlin Flow & Coroutines**  
  Used for asynchronous data handling and reactive UI updates.

- **SQLDelight**  
  Used for type-safe local data persistence.

- **Multi-Module Architecture**  
  Ensures a well-organized codebase with clear responsibility boundaries.

- **Unit & UI Testing**  
  Includes both unit tests and UI tests to ensure app stability and correctness.

## üéØ Architecture Highlights

- MVI pattern enables a clear and predictable state management flow.
- Multi-module structure improves modularity and team collaboration.
- Emphasis on Clean Code and SOLID principles ensures maintainable and scalable architecture.
- Reactive UI powered by Compose, Flow, and Coroutines.
- Persistent local storage with SQLDelight.
